# Welcome to Lampo: A New Dawn in Lightning Node Technology

Hello to the Lightning and Bitcoin communities!

We're thrilled to introduce **Lampo**, our open-source lightning node implementation crafted meticulously
in Rust. As technology enthusiasts deeply entrenched in the world of Bitcoin and
its associated technologies, we noticed a space for an alternative. A space for something robust, transparent, and community-driven. That’s where Lampo steps in.

## Why Lampo?

While there are renowned lightning implementations like core lightning, lnd, and eclair, none resonated
with our vision for an open-source lightning node built upon the [ldk](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning). Our goal is to
offer a platform that's not just driven by business needs but also by genuine innovation and community feedback.

## Unique Features

Lampo boasts features like swappable APIs, on-chain data sources, and a flexible wallet system.
And yes, we’re future-ready! Plans are already underway to support Fedimint, LSP, and VLS. Our dedication towards
creating a powerful architecture will ensure Lampo serves all the needs of the modern lightning network community.

## Join the Conversation

Lampo is more than just software; it's a movement. A movement towards better, more transparent, and community-centric lightning node
technology. We're excited for you to join us on this journey, contribute, question, and help us shape the future of the Lightning Network.

Stay electrified!

Vincent.
